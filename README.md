# Design Patterns in JS

Implementation of Design Patterns in JavaScript.

Design Patterns are proven solutions that can help you solve problems. For a problem, you may have many available solutions. It depends. They're not a golden hammer. Sometimes, no pattern would apply. In general, follow SOLID principles.

I use these to remember myself about the different patterns that exist and how they would look like in JavaScript. I also use these examples when IÂ make developers learn Design Patterns.
