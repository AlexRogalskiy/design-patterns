# Facade

Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## When to use?

When the APIÂ we need to use is more complex than we need, and we can't change it.

It can be use to provide a simpler API to a complex sub-system.

## Pros

- Gives a simpler API to work with.

## Cons

- One more layer of abstraction.
- It doesn't solve the root cause of the complex API design.
